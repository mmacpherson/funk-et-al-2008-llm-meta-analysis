          Does this paper discuss plant functional traits, which can also be
          referred to as "functional traits" or just "traits"?  Specific examples
          of common plant functional traits include, but are not limited to:
          - height
          - leaf dry matter content
          - leaf mass area
          - leaf nitrogen
          - root mass ratio
          - seed mass
          - seedling mass
          - specific leaf area
          - water use efficiency

          Here is some content excerpted from an article from the scientific
          literature:

          Journal: {journal}

          Title: {title}

          Sentences from article most semantically related to our questions,
          annotated with section heading where they occur:

          {selected_md}

          Question: Based on the above, which of these two possibilities is the correct one?
      choices:
          - prompt: The article reports original empirical research.
            next_node_id: 1
          - prompt: The article does not report original empirical research, e.g. is a review or commentary.

          We are still referring the article excerpted previously.

          Question: Based on the above, which of these two possibilities is the correct one?
      choices:
          - prompt: The article reports on a novel real-world experimental manipulation.
            next_node_id: 2
          - prompt: The article reports on something other than an experiment, like an observational study or analysis of preexisting results.

          Here is additional general background relevant to the next question:

          - Assume that the excerpts included above from the article contain any
            references to traits, so that if they are not in the excerpts, they
            are not in the article.
          - The term "plant functional traits" refers to the measurable features
            of plants that have functional significance.
          - Plant functional traits are not universally described in those exact
            terms; they're e.g. sometimes referred to as "functional
            traits" or just "traits".
          - To help you understand if plant functional traits might be
            discussed, but in alternative terms, common examples of plant
            functional traits include, but are not limited to:
              - height
              - leaf dry matter content
              - leaf mass area
              - leaf nitrogen
              - root mass ratio
              - seed mass
              - seedling mass
              - specific leaf area
              - water use efficiency

          Question: Based on the above, which of these two possibilities is the correct one?
      choices:
          - prompt: The article substantively involves plant functional traits.
            next_node_id: 3
          - prompt: The article does not involve plant functional traits, or mentions them only superficially.

          This question builds on the previous answers, so consider the entire
          chat history carefully.

          Additional background:

          - We are interested in whether plant functional traits are integral,
            or incidental, to the design of the experiment in this article.
          - "Integral" means that functional traits were part of the
            experimental hypothesis, i.e. that one or both of these are true:
              - Plant functional traits were used to SELECT the species for the
                experimental manipulation.
              - Plant functional traits wered used to IDENTIFY the experimental
                treatments (e.g., grazing, burning, carbon addition).
          - "Incidental" means that while functional traits may have been
            mentioned or even measured after the fact, they were not used to
            design the experiment.

          Question: Based on the above, which of these two possibilities is the correct one?
      choices:
          - prompt: Plant functional traits are integral to the design of the experiment.
            next_node_id: 103
          - prompt: Plant functional traits are incidental to the design of the experiment.
